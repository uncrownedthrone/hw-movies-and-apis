# Movies and APIs
## Deployed using Netlify: https://js-movies-and-apis.netlify.com

This assignment was one of our first looks at using a publicly available API to pull in movie information and display it on our page.

The most enjoyable aspect of this project was when my call to the API was written correctly and, on page refresh, all of the movie data I had asked for starting populating on the page. This was a turning point for me becuase up until that point, we had only used API calls to get a single, simple temperature reading. Watching images, text, and data for hundreds of movies populate on my page made me finally start to feel like a developer.

After completing this assignment, I was able to use the knowledge I gained to change several aspects such as pulling in movies that came out in 1985 instead of 1983, and sorting by their popularity as opposed to their release date.
